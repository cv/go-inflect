Benefits:\n\n- Native Go modules support\n- More reliable static site generation\n- Modern, maintained tooling\n- Better rendering of documentation\n\n## Implementation\n\n1. Replace `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc@latest` with `go install golang.org/x/pkgsite/cmd/pkgsite@latest`\n2. Update the static generation script to use pkgsite's local mode\n3.

Profile the function:\n```bash\ngo test -bench=BenchmarkPossessive -benchmem -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -memprofile=mem.prof ./...\ngo tool pprof -http=:8080 mem.prof\n```\n\n2. Review `possessive.go` for:\n   - Regex patterns compiled at runtime (should be `var re = regexp.MustCompile(...)` at package level)\n   - String concatenation in loops (use `strings.Builder`)\n   - Unnecessary intermediate strings\n\n## Likely optimizations\n\n1. **Pre-compile regexes**: Move all `regexp.MustCompile()` calls to package-level variables\n2. **Use strings.Builder**: Replace `+` concatenation with builder pattern\n3. **Avoid repeated lookups**: Cache results of expensive checks\n4. **Reduce branching**: Simplify logic paths\n\n## Verification\n```bash\n# Before\ngo test -bench=BenchmarkPossessive -benchmem -count=5 ./... \u003e old.txt\n\n# After changes\ngo test -bench=BenchmarkPossessive -benchmem -count=5 ./... \u003e new.txt\n\n# Compare\nbenchstat old.txt new.txt\n```\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n- Reduce allocations to ≤2 per call for common cases\n- Reduce latency to \u003c200ns for simple cases\n- All existing tests continue to pass\n- Document any behavior changes","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-27T18:46:08.261828-08:00","created_by":"cvillela","updated_at":"2025-12-27T19:21:44.27538-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-27T19:21:44.27538-08:00","close_reason":"Closed","labels":["performance"]}
